# Minimum String Length After Removing Substrings

The problem you're referring to asks us to minimize the length of a string by repeatedly removing substrings `"AB"` and `"CD"` until no such substrings remain. We need to implement an efficient solution to achieve this.

### Approach:

1. **Stack-based Approach**:
   - The simplest and most efficient way to solve this problem is by using a **stack**.
   - We traverse the string from left to right and push characters onto the stack.
   - Whenever we encounter a character that forms a pair `"AB"` or `"CD"` with the top of the stack, we remove (pop) the top of the stack instead of pushing the current character.
   - After traversing the entire string, the stack will contain the characters that cannot be removed.
   
2. **Time Complexity**:
   - Each character is processed at most twice: once when being pushed onto the stack and possibly once when being popped from the stack.
   - This gives a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string.

### Algorithm:
1. Traverse the string.
2. Use a stack to store characters that cannot yet form a valid removable substring.
3. For each character, check if it, along with the character at the top of the stack, forms a removable pair (`"AB"` or `"CD"`). If yes, pop the top of the stack; otherwise, push the current character onto the stack.
4. After the traversal is complete, the remaining characters in the stack form the final string.
5. The size of the stack is the minimized length of the string.

### Java Code Implementation:

```java
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public int minLength(String s) {
        // Initialize a stack to process the string
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();

        // Traverse through the string
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            // Check if the current character and the top of the stack form a removable pair
            if (!stack.isEmpty() && (
                    (stack.peek() == 'A' && c == 'B') || 
                    (stack.peek() == 'C' && c == 'D')
            )) {
                // If a removable pair is found, pop the top of the stack
                stack.pop();
            } else {
                // Otherwise, push the current character onto the stack
                stack.push(c);
            }
        }

        // Return the size of the stack, which is the minimized string length
        return stack.size();
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Stack Initialization**:
   - We initialize a stack to process characters from the string. The stack will help us track which characters can be removed based on the rules.

2. **String Traversal**:
   - For each character in the string, we check whether it can form a removable pair (`"AB"` or `"CD"`) with the character at the top of the stack.
   - If a removable pair is found, the top of the stack is popped.
   - If no removable pair is found, the current character is pushed onto the stack.

3. **Final Result**:
   - Once the traversal is complete, the stack will contain the characters that couldn't be removed.
   - The size of the stack gives the length of the minimized string.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
**Input**: `s = "ABFCACDB"`
- Processing the string:
  1. Push `A` onto the stack.
  2. `B` forms a pair `"AB"` with the top of the stack, so pop `A`.
  3. Push `F`.
  4. Push `C`.
  5. Push `A`.
  6. `C` forms a pair `"CD"` with the top of the stack, so pop `C`.
  7. Push `B`.
- The stack now contains `"F", "A", "B"`. The final length is 3.

**Output**: `3`.

#### Example 2:
**Input**: `s = "AABBCCDD"`
- Processing the string:
  1. Push `A`.
  2. Push `A`.
  3. Push `B`.
  4. Push `B`.
  5. Push `C`.
  6. Push `C`.
  7. Push `D`.
  8. Push `D`.
- No removable pairs are found, so the stack remains unchanged.

**Output**: `8`.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where `n` is the length of the string. Each character is processed at most twice: once when being pushed onto the stack and possibly once when being popped.
  
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \) in the worst case (if no characters are removed and the entire string is pushed onto the stack).

### Conclusion:
This solution efficiently minimizes the string length using a stack-based approach, processing each character in linear time. It ensures optimal performance even for large strings while maintaining clear, readable code.
