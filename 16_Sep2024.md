# Minimum Time Difference

To find the minimum time difference between time points in a list, we can break the problem down into several steps. The main challenges are converting the time points into a format suitable for calculation, sorting them, and handling the circular nature of time (i.e., the difference between the earliest and latest times across midnight).

## Steps to Implement the Solution
1. **Convert Time Points:** Each time in the `timePoints` array is converted from the "HH:MM" format to minutes since midnight (0 to 1439).
2. **Sort the Array:** After converting to minutes, sort the array. This allows for an efficient comparison of consecutive time points to find the minimum difference.
3. **Calculate Differences:** Iterate through the sorted array to compute the differences between consecutive time points. Additionally, handle the circular nature of the time by calculating the difference between the first and last time points (across midnight).
4. **Return the Minimum Difference:** Track the smallest difference and return it.

## Edge Cases
- **Duplicate Times:** If there are duplicate times in the input (e.g., ["23:59", "23:59"]), the minimum difference is `0`.
- **Boundary Values:** The algorithm must handle edge cases like the smallest time difference involving the start and end of the day, such as ["23:59", "00:00"].

## Time Complexity
- Converting time points to minutes takes \(O(n)\).
- Sorting the array takes \(O(n log n)\).
- Finding the minimum difference in a sorted array takes \(O(n)\).
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n log n)\).

## TypeScript Code Implementation
Hereâ€™s the code to solve the problem:

```typescript
function findMinDifference(timePoints: string[]): number {
    // Helper function to convert time in "HH:MM" format to minutes since midnight
    const timeToMinutes = (time: string): number => {
        const [hours, minutes] = time.split(':').map(Number);
        return hours * 60 + minutes;
    };

    // Convert all time points to minutes and sort them
    const minutesArray = timePoints.map(timeToMinutes);
    minutesArray.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let minDifference = Infinity;

    // Calculate differences between consecutive times
    for (let i = 1; i < minutesArray.length; i++) {
        const difference = minutesArray[i] - minutesArray[i - 1];
        minDifference = Math.min(minDifference, difference);
    }

    // Handle the circular difference (difference across midnight)
    const circularDifference = (1440 - minutesArray[minutesArray.length - 1]) + minutesArray[0];
    minDifference = Math.min(minDifference, circularDifference);

    return minDifference;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **`timeToMinutes` Function:** Converts a time string ("HH:MM") into the total minutes since midnight.
2. **Convert and Sort:** Converts each time in the `timePoints` array to minutes and sorts them in ascending order.
3. **Find Minimum Difference:** Iterates through the sorted `minutesArray` to find the smallest difference between consecutive time points.
4. **Handle Circular Difference:** Calculates the time difference between the last and first elements in the sorted list to account for the circular nature of time.
5. **Return the Minimum Difference:** Returns the smallest time difference found.

### Testing
Here are some test cases to validate the function:

```typescript
// Test cases
console.log(findMinDifference(["23:59", "00:00"])); // Expected: 1
console.log(findMinDifference(["01:01", "02:01", "03:01"])); // Expected: 60
console.log(findMinDifference(["05:31", "22:08", "00:35"])); // Expected: 87
console.log(findMinDifference(["00:00", "23:59", "00:00"])); // Expected: 0 (duplicate times)
console.log(findMinDifference(["12:30", "04:45", "18:00"])); // Expected: 270
```

## Best Practices Followed
- **Modular Design:** The `timeToMinutes` helper function isolates the logic for converting time strings, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.
- **Edge Case Handling:** The function handles edge cases such as duplicate times and circular time differences.
- **Efficiency:** The algorithm sorts the array and calculates differences in linear time, ensuring good performance.
