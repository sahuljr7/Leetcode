# Make Sum Divisible by P

The problem you're referring to from **GeeksforGeeks** (or similar to the **LeetCode problem** "Make Sum Divisible by `p`") asks us to find the minimum size subarray that can be removed from an array such that the sum of the remaining elements is divisible by `p`.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**:
   - An array `nums[]` of integers.
   - An integer `p`.
   
2. **Output**:
   - The length of the smallest subarray whose removal makes the sum of the remaining elements divisible by `p`. If no such subarray exists, return `-1`.

### Approach:

1. **Key Idea**:
   - We need to remove the smallest subarray such that the sum of the remaining elements is divisible by `p`. 
   - First, calculate the **total sum** of the array and find the **remainder** when the total sum is divided by `p`. Let's call this remainder `totalSum % p`. If this remainder is `0`, the array sum is already divisible by `p`, so no subarray needs to be removed.
   - Otherwise, we need to remove a subarray such that the remainder of its sum is equal to `totalSum % p`. The idea is to find a subarray whose sum is congruent to `totalSum % p` modulo `p`.

2. **Using Prefix Sum and HashMap**:
   - To efficiently find the smallest subarray, use the **prefix sum** approach combined with a **hash map** to track the prefix sum remainders modulo `p`.
   - The hash map will help to quickly check if a prefix sum remainder has been seen before, which would allow us to identify a potential subarray to remove.

3. **Algorithm**:
   1. Calculate the total sum of the array and its remainder modulo `p` (denoted as `targetMod`).
   2. Use a hash map to track the latest index where each prefix sum remainder modulo `p` has been seen.
   3. Traverse the array and update the prefix sum while checking if removing a subarray gives a remainder equal to `targetMod`.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array because we make a single pass through the array, and hash map operations are on average **O(1)**.

### Java Code Implementation:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int minSubarray(int[] nums, int p) {
        // Step 1: Calculate the total sum of the array
        long totalSum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            totalSum += num;
        }

        // Step 2: Find the remainder when the total sum is divided by p
        long targetMod = totalSum % p;
        if (targetMod == 0) {
            return 0; // If the total sum is already divisible by p, no subarray needs to be removed
        }

        // Step 3: Initialize the hash map to store prefix sum remainders and start the traversal
        HashMap<Long, Integer> prefixSumMap = new HashMap<>();
        prefixSumMap.put(0L, -1); // Base case: prefix sum modulo p of 0 at index -1
        
        long currentPrefixSum = 0;
        int minLength = nums.length; // Initialize with the maximum possible length

        // Step 4: Traverse through the array
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            currentPrefixSum += nums[i];
            long currentMod = currentPrefixSum % p;

            // Calculate the mod value we need to find in the prefix sum map
            long requiredMod = (currentMod - targetMod + p) % p;

            // Check if the required mod has been seen before in the prefix sum map
            if (prefixSumMap.containsKey(requiredMod)) {
                int prevIndex = prefixSumMap.get(requiredMod);
                minLength = Math.min(minLength, i - prevIndex); // Update the minimum length of subarray
            }

            // Update the prefix sum map with the current mod value
            prefixSumMap.put(currentMod, i);
        }

        // Step 5: Return the result: if no subarray was found, return -1, otherwise return the min length
        return (minLength == nums.length) ? -1 : minLength;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Total Sum Calculation**:
   - First, we compute the total sum of the array and calculate `totalSum % p`, which gives the remainder when the sum is divided by `p`.
   - If the remainder is `0`, the sum is already divisible by `p`, and we can return `0` as no subarray needs to be removed.

2. **Prefix Sum Map**:
   - We use a hash map (`prefixSumMap`) to store the prefix sum modulo `p` at each index. This helps in efficiently finding subarrays with the desired remainder when traversing the array.
   - The hash map stores pairs of `(prefixSum % p, index)` where `index` is the last position where this remainder was seen.

3. **Traversing the Array**:
   - As we traverse the array, we compute the current prefix sum and calculate its remainder modulo `p`. 
   - We then check if a previous prefix sum with a remainder such that removing the subarray between that prefix and the current position would make the remaining sum divisible by `p`.
   - If such a prefix is found, we update the minimum length of the subarray.

4. **Result**:
   - Finally, if we find a valid subarray, we return its length. If no valid subarray is found, return `-1`.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
  - We compute the total sum in \( O(n) \), and the traversal of the array to find the minimum subarray also takes \( O(n) \).
  - Hash map operations (insert and lookup) take \( O(1) \) on average.
  
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \) for storing the prefix sum map.

### Example Walkthrough:

For input:
```plaintext
nums = [3, 1, 4, 2], p = 6
```

1. **Total Sum**:
   - The total sum is `3 + 1 + 4 + 2 = 10`.
   - `10 % 6 = 4`, so the target mod is `4`. We need to remove a subarray such that the remaining sum has a remainder of `4`.

2. **Prefix Sum Traversal**:
   - As we traverse the array, we calculate prefix sums and check for subarrays that, when removed, leave the remainder as `0`.
   - We find that removing the subarray `[1, 4]` gives a valid result, and its length is `2`.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The smallest subarray to remove is `[1, 4]`, so the result is `2`.

### Conclusion:

This solution efficiently computes the minimum subarray to remove in order to make the sum of the remaining elements divisible by `p`. The combination of prefix sum and hash map ensures that the solution runs in \( O(n) \) time, making it suitable for large inputs.
