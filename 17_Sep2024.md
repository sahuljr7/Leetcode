# Uncommon Words from Two Sentences

To solve the problem of finding uncommon words from two sentences, let's break down the problem and build an efficient solution.

## Problem Breakdown
1. **Definition of Uncommon Words:** A word is considered uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences and not at all in the other.
2. **Input:** Two strings, `s1` and `s2`, representing two sentences.
3. **Output:** An array of words that are uncommon in both sentences.
4. **Plan:** We will count the occurrences of each word in both sentences, and then filter out the words that appear exactly once.

## Approach
1. **Concatenate Sentences:** Combine both sentences into a single string to simplify processing.
2. **Split into Words:** Use the `split` method to extract words, assuming words are separated by spaces.
3. **Count Word Occurrences:** Use a map to keep track of the count of each word.
4. **Find Uncommon Words:** Filter out words that appear exactly once in the map.
5. **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where sentences are empty or have no uncommon words.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the total number of words in both sentences. This includes splitting the sentences, counting the words, and filtering uncommon words.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to storing words in the map.

## TypeScript Code Implementation
Here's the complete implementation of the `uncommonFromSentences` function:

```typescript
function uncommonFromSentences(s1: string, s2: string): string[] {
    // Helper function to count word occurrences
    const countWords = (sentence: string): Map<string, number> => {
        const wordCount = new Map<string, number>();
        const words = sentence.split(' ');

        for (const word of words) {
            wordCount.set(word, (wordCount.get(word) || 0) + 1);
        }

        return wordCount;
    };

    // Count occurrences in both sentences
    const combinedCounts = countWords(s1);
    const s2Counts = countWords(s2);

    // Merge s2Counts into combinedCounts
    for (const [word, count] of s2Counts.entries()) {
        combinedCounts.set(word, (combinedCounts.get(word) || 0) + count);
    }

    // Filter words that occur exactly once
    const result: string[] = [];
    for (const [word, count] of combinedCounts.entries()) {
        if (count === 1) {
            result.push(word);
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Helper Function:** `countWords` takes a sentence, splits it into words, and counts the occurrences of each word using a `Map`.
2. **Count Words:** First, we count the words in `s1` and `s2` separately using `countWords`.
3. **Merge Counts:** We then merge the word counts from `s2` into `s1`'s map to get the total word occurrences across both sentences.
4. **Filter Uncommon Words:** Iterate over the map to collect words that appear exactly once.
5. **Return the Result:** Return the list of uncommon words.

### Testing
Here are some test cases to validate the implementation:

```typescript
// Test cases
console.log(uncommonFromSentences("this apple is sweet", "this apple is sour")); 
// Expected: ["sweet", "sour"]

console.log(uncommonFromSentences("apple apple", "banana")); 
// Expected: ["banana"]

console.log(uncommonFromSentences("", "banana orange apple")); 
// Expected: ["banana", "orange", "apple"]

console.log(uncommonFromSentences("hello world", "hello")); 
// Expected: ["world"]

console.log(uncommonFromSentences("unique words here", "totally different words")); 
// Expected: ["unique", "here", "totally", "different"]
```

### Edge Cases
- Empty input strings.
- Sentences with all words in common.
- Sentences where words appear more than once.

### Best Practices Followed
- **Modularity:** Separated the word-counting logic into a helper function (`countWords`), improving code readability and maintainability.
- **Map for Counting:** Used a `Map` to efficiently count occurrences of words.
- **Edge Case Handling:** The implementation handles cases where words do not exist in both sentences or where sentences are empty.
