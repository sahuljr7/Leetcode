# Largest Number

To solve the problem of forming the largest possible number from an array of integers, we need to carefully arrange the numbers. The key challenge is to decide how to order two numbers to maximize the overall concatenation result.

## Approach to the Solution
1. **Custom Sorting:** The main idea is to define a custom comparator for sorting the numbers. For two numbers \(a\) and \(b\), we need to decide if the concatenation of \(a\) followed by \(b\) (`a + b`) is larger than \(b\) followed by \(a\) (`b + a`). The comparison will guide the sorting order.
2. **Edge Cases:** 
   - If all numbers are zeros (e.g., `[0, 0, 0]`), the result should be `"0"` instead of multiple zeros.
3. **Join Sorted Numbers:** Once sorted using the custom comparator, concatenate the numbers to form the largest number.
4. **Time Complexity:** Sorting the numbers takes \(O(n \log n)\). Since each comparison involves concatenating strings of numbers, this solution is efficient for reasonable input sizes.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)` due to sorting, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. Each comparison has a fixed complexity since it involves string concatenation.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for storing the numbers as strings during the sorting and final concatenation.

## TypeScript Code Implementation
Hereâ€™s the complete implementation of the `largestNumber` function:

```typescript
function largestNumber(nums: number[]): string {
    // Convert numbers to strings for concatenation comparison
    const numStrings = nums.map(num => num.toString());

    // Custom sort: Compare a + b and b + a to decide the order
    numStrings.sort((a, b) => (b + a).localeCompare(a + b));

    // Edge case: If the largest number is '0', return '0'
    if (numStrings[0] === '0') {
        return '0';
    }

    // Join sorted numbers to form the largest number
    return numStrings.join('');
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Convert Numbers to Strings:** Convert each number to a string since concatenation and comparison will be easier in string format.
2. **Custom Sorting:** Use `sort` with a custom comparator that compares two numbers `a` and `b` by checking the concatenated result of `b + a` vs. `a + b`. If `b + a` is greater, it means `b` should come before `a` in the final number to maximize the result.
3. **Handle Edge Case:** After sorting, if the largest number is `"0"`, return `"0"` (handles cases where all numbers are zeros).
4. **Concatenate Strings:** Join the sorted array to form the final largest number.

### Testing the Code
Here are some test cases to validate the implementation:

```typescript
// Test cases
console.log(largestNumber([10, 2]));             // Expected: "210"
console.log(largestNumber([3, 30, 34, 5, 9]));   // Expected: "9534330"
console.log(largestNumber([1]));                 // Expected: "1"
console.log(largestNumber([10]));                // Expected: "10"
console.log(largestNumber([0, 0]));              // Expected: "0"
console.log(largestNumber([999, 99, 9]));        // Expected: "999999"
console.log(largestNumber([121, 12]));           // Expected: "12121"
console.log(largestNumber([8308, 830]));         // Expected: "8308830"
```

### Edge Cases
- Input with single element.
- Arrays containing zeros only (e.g., `[0, 0, 0]`).
- Large numbers of varying lengths.

### Best Practices Followed
- **Clear Logic:** The sorting comparator is designed to handle the key logic of maximizing the concatenated result.
- **Edge Case Handling:** The function checks if the final number should be `"0"` in cases where all elements are zeros.
- **Efficiency:** The custom sorting ensures that the time complexity remains manageable for reasonable input sizes.
